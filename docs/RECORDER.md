# Home Assistant Recorder recommendation

Gewitterradar uses short-lived lightning entities and frequently updated lightning sensors. For installations with frequent lightning activity, excluding these entities from long-term Home Assistant Recorder storage is recommended.

Add the following to `configuration.yaml`. If a top-level `recorder:` section already exists, integrate the entries into that existing section instead of creating a second `recorder:` key:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - "geo_location.lightning_strike*"
    entities:
      - sensor.home_lightning_distance
      - sensor.home_lightning_azimuth
      - sensor.home_lightning_counter
```

The exclusion affects future Recorder/History storage for these entities; it does not disable their current live states for Gewitterradar. Existing historical data is not removed automatically.

The actual number of lightning entities available to Home Assistant depends on the Blitzortung.org integration settings, especially detection radius, time window and the configured maximum number of lightning events. Larger values can increase system load during high lightning activity.
